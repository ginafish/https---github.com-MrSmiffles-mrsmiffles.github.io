	<p>
		When making calls with the BLS API, you must select between using Version 1.0 calls and Version 2.0 calls.
	</p>
    <h3>When to use Version 1.0:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You are only planning to send 25 or fewer queries per day.</li>
        <li>You are only going to include 25 or less serieses per query.</li>
        <li>You will only ask for 10 or less years per query.</li>
        <li>You are not looking for aggregate statistics like net/percent changes, optional annual averages, and series description information from the catalog.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>With Version 2.0:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>You are required to make an account and receive an API key to use Version 2.0.  After registering, check your e-mail for a confirmation e-mail that will include your API key. <a href="http://data.bls.gov/registrationEngine/" target="_blank">Click here to register.</a></li>
        <li>You get up to 500 queries per day.</li>
        <li>You can include up to 50 serieses per query, and can call data for up to 20 years' worth per query.</li>
        <li>You can query for net/percent changes, optional annual averages, and series description information from the catalog.</li>
        <li>Version 2.0 also supports x-www-form-urlencoded content type for the request body, as well as excel spreadsheet (XLSX), but the latter is outside the scope of this guide.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Basically, you get more features with Version 2.0 than Version 1.0, but you may not want to go to the trouble of registering for an API key if you're only doing a few simple queries.</p>
